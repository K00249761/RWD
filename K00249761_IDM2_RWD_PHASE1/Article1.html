			<p>This week at Bungie, we talk story and sandbox.</p>
			<p>Before we kick this TWAB off, I have to ask: Have you watched the new story trailer for Beyond Light yet? No? While we aren’t going to dive deeply into spoiler territory between now and launch, this is the moment where we say it’s time for you to go dark if you're looking to experience the expansion with no knowledge of what's coming. </p>
			<p>If you’re hungry, it’s time to dig in.</p>
			<p>Eramis is on the warpath. Variks warns of catastrophe. The Exo Stranger has been waiting for you. A few extra details can be found on the Beyond Light: Story page on Bungie.net. Jump in if you’d like to know more. </p>
			<p>Soon, you’ll be exploring Europa, in search of answers. Whether you be a lone wolf or part of a fireteam, we’ll leave that path for you to walk. </p>
			<p>Two weeks ago, we began a conversation about sandbox tuning for Beyond Light. Armor modifications are getting some hefty changes, from reloads to raids. If you missed it, check out the October 8 TWAB. This week, our focus shifts to the weapons in your arsenal. As with our mods preview, we have a collection of patch notes accompanied by developer commentary. Alright, we ready?</p>
			<p>Let’s pass the microphone over to the Dev Team for some juicy details. </p>
			<p>Dev team: Hello! Today, we’ll be covering some changes to a few specific weapons and weapon families. For those of you who don’t have much knowledge of our sandbox, each weapon has a specific “frame” that is also tied to its associated rate of fire (RoF). We’ve included both of these for a bit of clarity, as many players default to RoF when talking about various weapons. As an example, “Aggressive” Hand Cannons currently have a RoF of 110 rounds per minute. </p>

			<p>Hand Cannons</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Aggressive </li>
				<li>Increased RoF from 110 to 120.</li>
				<li>Broke out Aggressive Hand Cannons, allowing custom tuning of stats (e.g. damage falloff for 100 range in this subfamily now starts at 32m). </li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li>Adaptive and Precision </li>
				<li>Range stat now has more impact on minimum damage falloff range for both archetypes.</li>
				<li>Damage falloff for 100 range now starts at 25m, was 20m.</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li>Precision Hand Cannon</li>
				<li>(180 RoF) magazine scaled up by 37 percent.</li>
				<li>Note: This also affects Exotics with that rate of fire. </li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li>Lightweight (folded in to Adaptive) </li>
				<li>Moved all Lightweight Hand Cannons (150 RoF) to the Adaptive subfamily (140 RoF).</li>
				<li>This includes Luna’s Howl and Not Forgotten.</li>
				<li>One Exotic Hand Cannon will retain 150 ROF.</li>
				<li>We aren’t going to leave it to speculation.</li>
				<li>It’s beautiful.</li>
				<li>It does solar damage.</li>
				<li>It makes enemies explode.</li>
				<li>It’s Sunshot.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>At this time, Lightweight (150 ROF) Hand Cannons represent the majority of Hand Cannon usage in the Crucible. While we experimented with many different ways to even out Lightweights (150 ROF) and Adaptives (140 ROF), Lightweight Hand Cannons consistently retained a faster time to kill (TTK). As such, we opted to equalize their ROF.</p>
			<p>We selected 140 ROF as it is fairly balanced in the Crucible sandbox. It gives other weapon archetypes more time to breath between shots, avoids an overabundance of Hand Cannons with faster TTK than other weapons, and pairs nicely with upcoming changes to 600 ROF Auto Rifles (more on that below).</p>
			<p>Sniper Rifles: We want Sniper Rifles to feel powerful, without being so easy to use that they dominate.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Adjusted how aim assist (AA) is affected by Sniper Rifle zoom level. Lower zoom scopes have less AA, higher zoom scopes have more, scopes with around 50 zoom are unchanged.</li>
				<li>Lowest-zoom scopes have a large reduction in AA cone angle.</li>
				<li>Highest-zoom scopes have a small increase.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Auto Rifles: In Season of the Worthy, the Adaptive archetype (600 RoF) was given a buff. We’re pulling that back a little to keep it in check with other Auto Rifle archetypes.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Adaptive</li>
				<li>Damage per bullet reduced from 15.75 to 14.25.</li>
				<li>Note: Prior to Season of the Worthy, damage per bullet was 13.75.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Scout Rifles: Scouts have a reasonable time to kill (TTK)and can't be adjusted too much without making them dominate the battlefield, so we're making them a little easier to use.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Increased how much each point of the AA stat widens the AA cone.</li>
				<li>At maximum, the AA cone is now 15 percent wider.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Rocket Launchers: These Heavy weapons currently have very low reserves, so we're adjusting that. We expect to take another look at Rocket Launchers in a future Season.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Increased reserves by 1 or 2 rockets depending on Inventory stat.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The days are continuing to grow shorter here in Seattle. Pretty soon, Destiny won’t be the only thing enveloped in Darkness. I for one can’t wait. Only two more TWABs stand between you and Europa.</p>
			<p>Ah, and before we go – we've been seeing a lot of questions in the wild on how bounties, currencies, and progression systems will be updated in Beyond Light. We’re currently working to get the info together and making sure everything is factual. This isn’t a “preppers guide to the galaxy,” mind you. Just a heads up on how these systems are changing. Our current plan is to cover those topics next week! The most frequent question we’re seeing right now concerns bounties, and whether they’ll be cleared at the start of next Season.</p>
			<p>Most of your bounties will stay intact, but any bounties tied to specific Seasonal activities or content entering the DCV will be removed on November 10. Examples would include Black Armory, Gambit Prime, or Festival of the Lost bounties. Additionally, any bounties that grant progression towards Infamy/Valor may negatively impact your powerful rewards, as they will be limited to Season of Arrivals Power Levels. Our recommendation is to go ahead and claim your bounties, just to make sure you don’t miss out on any XP or Glimmer.</p>
			<p>Cheers, Seanog</p>

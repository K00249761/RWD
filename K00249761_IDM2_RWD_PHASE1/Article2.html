			<p class="headline"><a>TWAB: THIS WEEK AT BUNGIE </a></p>
	</div>

	<div class="maintext">
			<p>This week at Bungie, the Crow has found a new nest.</p>
			<p>Hello, and welcome to the second TWAB of Beyond Light. We’ve got a bit to cover today, so we won’t spend too much time on introductions. Season of the Hunt kicked off proper on Tuesday. If you haven’t jumped in just yet, we have some wonderful web lore to get you prepared. I wasn’t mentally prepared for part 2...</p>
			<p>TUNING THE DARKNESS</p>
			<p>It’s not often that an entirely new subclass makes its entrance into the ecosystem of Destiny 2. The team has been hard at work over the last year building abilities and Supers powered by the Darkness. Enemies around the solar system are shaking in fear of your Stasis powers, including your fellow Guardians in the Crucible.</p>
			<p>Development Team: We have seen a lot of feedback on Stasis since Beyond Light launched last week. We’ve heard it’s a ton of fun to use, but certain aspects of this new subclass can be frustrating to go up against (looking at you, Shadebinder Warlocks). We have a few minor tweaks planned to go out in Hotfix 3.0.0.3 this week. Our goal here is to do some early tuning to rein Shadebinders back in while still maintaining their overall efficacy and power fantasy</p>

			<p>Stasis Changes</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Stasis Breakout Damage reduced (110->90hp). </li>
				<li>Adjusted the curve that reduces breakout damage using resilience.</li>
				<li>Increased the damage reduction effect resilience has so that higher tiers of Resilience are more valuable.</li>
				<li>Caps out at 90 Resilience.</li>
				<li>Penumbral Blast (Stasis Warlock Melee) projectile speed reduced by 20%.</li>
				<li>Penumbral Blast (Stasis Warlock Melee) range reduced (was 28m now 16m).</li>
				<li>Winter Wrath (Stasis Warlock Super) duration reduced (30s -> 24s).</li>
				<li>Winters Wrath Light Attack (Stasis Warlock Super) cost reduced (5% per burst -> 4.5% per burst).</li>
				<li>Cold Snap seeker speed reduced by 23%.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Against Guardians:</p>

			<ul>
			<li>Cold Snap freeze duration lowered (4.75s -> 1.35s).</li>
				<li>Ice Flare Bolts freeze duration lowered (4.75s -> 1.35s).</li>
				<li>Penumbral Blast (Stasis Warlock Melee) freeze duration lowered (4.75s -> 1.35s).</li>
				<li>Winters Wrath Heavy attack (Stasis Warlock Super) no longer affects players who are not encased.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>With all that said, we believe strongly in the “cosmic ice” wizard fantasy in PvE so we’re trying to target changes where we can towards the PvP experience specifically. With Stasis we’ve tried to push the sandbox in new directions and that increases the likelihood we introduce something spicier than normal.</p>
			<p>When it comes to crafting new abilities, we believe the risk of shipping something a little hot is better than playing it safe and shipping something that doesn’t get you excited. As always, we’re going to be using data, playtesting, and feedback to help refine our direction and we’re going to keep responding. This will not be the last change to Stasis this Season. As we get closer to future changes, we’ll make another appearance in the TWAB for a patch note preview.</p>
			<p>Thanks for playing, and we’ll see you out there in the wild.</p>

			<p>LET'S TALK LOOT</p>

			<p>Since Beyond Light launched, we’ve been working through a whirlwind of feedback. What feels good, what needs work, and most importantly, how are you feeling? Today, we’ll be talking through a bit of player feedback concerning loot, and some short term plans the development team is working on.</p>

			<p>Development Team: As Beyond Light has launched we've been tracking your feedback around loot, particularly weapons, and wanted to take a moment to let you know how we are processing it. Today we're going to talk mostly about the short-term, with more information to follow in the future around the long-term as we work through those problems.</p>

			<p>Infusion caps are intended to help keep Destiny 2 evolving and ensure that every release the new rewards are exciting and relevant to the meta. However, we agree with your feedback that there’s currently not enough variety in the world loot weapons available to players this season.</p>

			<p>To that end we are adding back in a selection of weapons that will help alleviate this issue. We will also be watching to see how the landscape changes with the addition of weapons from Season 12 and this week’s Raid launch. We also agree that getting near-cap weapons from random world drops is frustrating. Thus, we are removing those from the pool, and are weighting drops more heavily towards newer weapons.</p>

			<p>Here’s a list of adjustments to the world loot legendary weapons pool you’ll see with our November 24 hotfix:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Remove all legendary weapons that hit their infusion cap at the end of this season </li>
				<li>Add all of the Seventh Seraph weapons from Season 10</li>
				<li>Add all of the Season 11 seasonal and planetary reprisal weapons </li>
				<li>Weight drop chances so the newer an item is, the more likely it is to drop.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>While we are not yet ready to dive into the long-term strategy yet, we are listening to feedback and watching how the player build landscape evolves over these first few weeks of Beyond Light, and incorporating that feedback as we plan out future Seasons.</p>

			<p>Feedback never stops, and we’re always excited to hear how you’re feeling about Destiny 2. Keep it coming.</p>

			<p>I’ll admit, this TWAB has been somewhat difficult to write. Don’t get me wrong, what’s said above is incredibly important! Charity initiatives to help those in need, the upcoming raid race, new security measures, and Stasis tuning are great things to see. It’s always a fun time collaborating with the various teams of Bungie to get you a weekly dose of information. </p>
			<p>...wait, I'll more than likely see you on Saturday for a raid race. Either way, I hope you are in good health, and wish you a good weekend.</p>
		
			<p>Cheers, Seanog</p>
